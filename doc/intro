    FIRST DRAFT OF MONTAG DOCUMENTATION - INTRO

    Hi, this is montag! montag is a pythonic commandline
    YAML/JSON (?) driven static site generator. It's not 
    yet 0.1, but it's coming along nicely. Very nicely.

    So you are interested in checking out montag? Well,
    as I said, not everything is ready, but here's what
    you can do for now.
    
        1. git clone this repo (https://github.com/unicorim
           /montag.git)
        2. Change the `src_path` in lib/webapp.py [1] to
           your own (be wary of the directories!)
        3. `touch $src_path/(.*?).txt` -- HAS TO BE .TXT [2]
        4. run `python lib/webapp.py` and visit localhost:8080
        5. from localhost, checkout /(\d+)

    montag is constantly on the move, so always check out for
    updates. If you actually play with montag at it's current
    state, I appalaud you.

    [1] montag will soon with it's very own interactive config
    [2] {.*?) has to be a number at the moment
