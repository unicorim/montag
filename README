MONTAG(1)

Hi, for those who starred and forked this repo, I can explain
montag took a dive for the worst and volunteered to be rewritten
in IO. So, if you were looking forward to dat pythonic static site
generator, look elsewhere like hyde. Thank you for taking interest
for this long and see you again next time.

For new users: hiya! this is montag, a now IO based static site 
generator. I've decided to use in favour of python, cos python is
boring you know
